## The Coin Pig BOC (Hackathon)

During the Bank of Cyprus 4.0 2023 Hackathon, our team successfully crafted a financial literacy web application tailored for teenagers. This innovative platform empowers them to gain insights into various financial products and offers a simulated environment for investing their funds. By utilizing this application, they can refine their financial decision-making skills and experience the outcomes of successful investments or learn from any potential missteps, ultimately enhancing their financial literacy and prudence.
